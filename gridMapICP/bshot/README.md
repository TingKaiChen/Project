# Source Code of B-SHOT

1. PCL needs to be installed on the system.

2. In the CMakeLists.txt file, make sure that the code finds PCL installed in your system

3. We provide a default implementation for SHOT matching and B-SHOT matching with some sample point clouds that are provided with the source code.
